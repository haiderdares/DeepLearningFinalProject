Deep Learning Final Project

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the final project of the Deep Learning and Neural Networks course (ASDS 5305). This repository contains our work on applying deep learning techniques to various datasets and documenting our findings.

Project Overview

We will be working on three different Python notebooks, each focusing on a different dataset. Our objective is to analyze these datasets using deep learning models, derive insights, and present our findings.
